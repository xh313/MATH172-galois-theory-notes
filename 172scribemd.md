Why do we want ID? **Cancellation properties**.

-   If $R$ is an ID, $a,b,c\in R$, $a\neq 0$ and $ab=ac$, then
    $$ab-ac=0\implies a(b-c)=0 \implies b-c=0 \implies b=c$$

-   If $r$ and $s$ are irreducibles with $r=us$, then $r$ and $s$ are
    called **associates**.

-   All "prime integers" are irreducibles in $\mathbb{Z}$;

-   2,3, $1+\sqrt{-5}, 1-\sqrt{-5}$ are irreducibles in
    $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$.

    -   Note: $2\times 3= (1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})=6$ says that 6 can
        be factored in more than one way. This means that
        $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is NOT an UFD.

If $a$ is a nonzero, nonunit element of UFD $R$ and
$a=r_1r_2\dots r_m=s_1\dots s_n$ where $r_i,s_j$ are irreducible, then
after reordering $r_i=u_is_i$ for any $i$ and units $u_i$, and $m=n$.

Why do we want ideals? Such that $R/I$ is a well-defined ring. {0} and
$R$ are ideals of $R$. If $R$ is commutative and $a\in R$, then
$(a)=\{ar\mid r\in R\}$ is called the **principal ideal** generated by
$a$.

The only ideals of $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ are of the form $n\mathbb{Z}=(n)$.
$\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a UFD but NOT a PID because the ideal
$(2,x)=\{2r+xs\mid r,s\in \mathbb{Z}[x]\}$ is not principal.

If $I\subseteq R$ is an ideal and $1\in I$, then
$I=R$.[]{#lemma:1-in-I-then-I-is-R label="lemma:1-in-I-then-I-is-R"} Try
it!

If $I\subseteq R$ is an ideal containing a unit of $R$ then $I=R$. If
$u\in I$ is a unit then $u^{-1}\in R$, so $uu^{-1}=1\in I$. Then the
result follows from

A **field** is a commutative ring whose [each nonzero element is a

**field**.

Suppose $a\in R\backslash \{0\}$ and consider $(a)$. Since
$a\in (a),\, (a)=R$. Hence, we must have that $1\in(a)$, which means
$1=ar$ for some $r\in R$.0◻

$(6)$ is not a prime ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$ since $2\times 3\in (6)$ but
neither $2,3\notin (6)$. $(2)$ is not a prime ideal of
$\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ since $6\in (2)$, but we observe that
$6=(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})$ while $1\pm \sqrt{-5}\notin (2)$. (2) is
a prime ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$.

[*(The following is kind of on a tangent)*]{style="color: darkgray"}

A commutative ring $R$ with unity is called **Noetherian** if, whenever
$I_1\subseteq I_2\subseteq \dots$ is an ascending sequence of (proper)
ideals of $R$, there exists an $n>0$ such that $I_n=I_{n+1}=\dots$ are
the same ideals thereafter.

::: theorem
** 6**. $R$ is Noetherian *if and only if* all ideals of $R$ are
finitely generated.

** 7**. All Principal Ideal Domains are Noetherian.

Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring with $1\neq 0$ and $I\subseteq R$ is
an ideal. Then the [**quotient ring**]{.underline} of $R$ by $I$ is the
set $$R/I=\{r+I\mid r\in R\}$$ with addition and multiplication defined
representative-wise.

The **coset criterion** of ideals: let $I$ be an ideal; the cosets
$r+I$, $s+I$ are the same *if and only if* $r-s\in I$.

-   In $\mathbb{Z}/(6)$ aka. $\mathbb{Z\text{/6}Z}$, we have
    $2+(6)=\{\dots,-10,-4,2,8,14,\dots\} = 26+(6)$ due to $2-26\in (6)$;

-   In $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-2)$, we have
    $$\{3x^2-47x+1+q(x)(x^2-2)\mid q(x)\in \mathbb{Q}[x]\} = \{-47x+7+q(x)(x^2-2)\mid q(x)\in \mathbb{Q}[x]\}$$
    due to $3x^2-47x+1-(-47x+7)\in (x^2-2)$.

Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. Then
[$(I,+)\trianglelefteq(R,+)$]{.underline}.

$R/I$ is a group under $(r+I)+(s+I)=(r+s)+I$ and the operation + is
well-defined. We also define that $(r+I)(s+I)=(rs)+I$. We claim that
multiplication in $R/I$ is also well-defined.

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $r_1+I=r_2+I$ and $s_1+I=s_2+I$. By coset criterion,
$r_1-r_2=i$, $s_1-s_2=j$ for some $i,j\in I$. Hence
$r_1s_1=(r_2+i)(s_2+j)=r_2s_2+is_2+jr_2+ij$ where the latter three terms
are all in the ideal $I$. Thus, $(r_1s_1)+I=(r_2s_2)+I$.0◻ ◻
:::

From $R$, $R/I$ inherits nice properties:

-   $0+I=0_{R/I}$

-   $1+I=1_{R/I}$

-   Multiplication is commutative and distributive over addition in
    $R/I$, so it is also a comm. ring with identity.

A function $\varphi: R\rightarrow S$ between rings is called a **ring
homomorphism** if the following are satisfied:

-   $\varphi (r_1+r_2)=\varphi (r_1)+\varphi (r_2)$

-   $\varphi (r_1r_2)=\varphi (r_1)\varphi (r_2)$

::: theorem
** 8**. [First ring isomorphism theorem]{.underline}

If $\varphi: R\mapsto S$ is a ring homomorphism, then
$R/\ker(\varphi)\cong \varphi (R)$.
:::

If $R$ is a ring and $I$ is an ideal, then $\pi : R\rightarrow R/I$
where $r\mapsto r+I$ is a surjective homomorphism where $\ker(\pi)=I$.
This is the *canonical projection* onto $R/I$.

::: corollary
** 9**. If $I$ is a maximal ideal, then $R/I$ is a field.
