	abstract = {The problem of classifying off-shell representations of the \$N\$-extended one-dimensional super Poincar{\textbackslash}'\{e\} algebra is closely related to the study of a class of decorated graphs known as Adinkras. We show that these combinatorial objects possess a form of emergent supergeometry: Adinkras are equivalent to very special super Riemann surfaces with divisors. The method of proof critically involves Grothendieck's theory of "dessins d'enfants'', work of Cimasoni-Reshetikhin expressing spin structures on Riemann surfaces via dimer models, and an observation of Donagi-Witten on parabolic structure from ramified coverings of super Riemann surfaces.},

Actually, since elliptic curves are curves of genus one, one of our tasks will be to define the genus of a curve. As in Chapter I, we give references for those proofs that are not included. There are many books in which the reader will find more material on the subject of algebraic curves, for example[111, Chapter {IV}], [133], [180], [243], [99, Chapter 2], and [302].},
