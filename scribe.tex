\proposition If $I\subseteq R$ is an ideal containing a unit of $R$ then $I=R$.

\defn A \textbf{field} is a commutative ring whose \uline{each nonzero element is a \textit{unit}}.

    If $R$ is an ID whose ideals are $(0)$ and $R$, then $R$ is a \textbf{field}.

\proof Suppose $a\in R\backslash \{0\}$ and consider $(a)$. Since $a\in (a),\, (a)=R$. Hence, we must have that $1\in(a)$, which means $1=ar$ for some $r\in R$.\qed

\defn Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring with $1\neq 0$ and $I\subseteq R$ is an ideal. Then the \underline{\textbf{quotient ring}} of $R$ by $I$ is the set $$R/I=\{r+I\mid r\in R\}$$ with addition and multiplication defined representative-wise.
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Quotient Rings}

\rmk The \textbf{coset criterion} of ideals: let $I$ be an ideal; the cosets $r+I$, $s+I$ are the same \textit{if and only if} $r-s\in I$.

\eg \hfill
\begin{itemize}
    \item In $\Z/(6)$ aka. $\znz{6}$, we have $2+(6)=\{\dots,-10,-4,2,8,14,\dots\} = 26+(6)$ due to $2-26\in (6)$;
    \item In $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2-2)$, we have $$\{3x^2-47x+1+q(x)(x^2-2)\mid q(x)\in \mathbb{Q}[x]\} = \{-47x+7+q(x)(x^2-2)\mid q(x)\in \mathbb{Q}[x]\}$$ due to $3x^2-47x+1-(-47x+7)\in (x^2-2)$.
\end{itemize}

\rmk Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. Then \underline{$(I,+)\nsub (R,+)$}. 

\defn $R/I$ is a group under $(r+I)+(s+I)=(r+s)+I$ and the operation + is well-defined. We also define that $(r+I)(s+I)=(rs)+I$. We claim that multiplication in $R/I$ is also well-defined.
\begin{proof}
    Let $r_1+I=r_2+I$ and $s_1+I=s_2+I$. By coset criterion, $r_1-r_2=i$, $s_1-s_2=j$ for some $i,j\in I$. Hence $r_1s_1=(r_2+i)(s_2+j)=r_2s_2+is_2+jr_2+ij$ where the latter three terms are all in the ideal $I$. Thus, $(r_1s_1)+I=(r_2s_2)+I$.
\end{proof}

From $R$, $R/I$ inherits nice properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $0+I=0_{R/I}$
    \item $1+I=1_{R/I}$
    \item Multiplication is commutative and distributive over addition in $R/I$, so it is also a comm. ring with identity.
\end{itemize}

\defn A function $\varphi: R\rightarrow S$ between rings is called a \textbf{ring homomorphism} if the following are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\homo{r_1+r_2}=\homo{r_1}+\homo{r_2}$
    \item $\homo{r_1r_2}=\homo{r_1}\homo{r_2}$
\end{itemize}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Ring homomorphism}

\begin{theorem}\label{FIT}
    \underline{First ring isomorphism theorem}\sidenote{Observe that kernels are ideals! And ideals are kernels of some homomorphism too.}

    If  $\varphi: R\mapsto S$ is a ring homomorphism, then $R/\ker(\varphi)\cong \homo{R}$.
\end{theorem}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{First ring isomorphism theorem}

\eg If $R$ is a ring and $I$ is an ideal, then $\pi : R\rightarrow R/I$ where $r\mapsto r+I$ is a surjective homomorphism where $\ker(\pi)=I$. This is the \textit{canonical projection} onto $R/I$.

\begin{corollary}
    If $I$ is a maximal ideal, then $R/I$ is a field.
\end{corollary}\sidenote{The \ifnif version comes in \cref{quotient-max-field}.}

Recall \cref{mod-zero-ideal}. We now have a stronger statement:

\begin{proposition}
    Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring \& $P\subseteq R$ is an ideal. Then $R/P$ is an integral domain \textit{if and only if }$P$ is prime.
\end{proposition}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Quotient by prime ideal is ID}
\begin{proof}
    $R/P$ is an integral domain \ifnif whenever $(a+P)(b+P)=0_{R/P}$ then one of $a+P$ or $b+P$ must already be $0_{R/P}$. This happens \ifnif whenever $ab+P=P$ then $a+P$ or $b+P$ in $P$, which happens \ifnif whenever $ab\in P$ then one of $a,b\in P$, which is the definition of a prime ideal.
\end{proof}

\eg The map $\varphi: \Z[x]\to \Z$ where $p(x)\mapsto p(0)$ is a surjective ring homomorphism with $\ker(\varphi)=(x)$. By the the First Isomorphism \cref{FIT}, $\Z[x]/(x)\cong \Z$. \sidenote{btw, $(x)\subsetneq (x,2)$. the latter is the set of polynomials whose \uline{constant term is even}, so it is also a proper ideal of $\Z[x]$. This is an excellent example where Prime $\nRightarrow$ Maximal.} As such, we conclude that $(x)$ is a prime ideal since $\Z$ is an integral domain.

\begin{lemma}
    Suppose $R$ is a comm. ring with $M\subseteq R$ being an ideal. \\
    There is a bijective correspondence between the ideals of $R/M$ and the ideals of $R$ containing $M$.
\end{lemma}\label[lemma]{4th-isomorphism-thrm}
\begin{proof}
    Consider the projection $\pi:R\to R/M$ where $r\mapsto r+M$. It is enough to show: \sidenote{To see why this is okay, see Homework 2 Sec. 7.3 P. 24}\begin{align*}
        \pi(\inv{\pi}(J))&=J && \text{for all ideals } J\subseteq R/M \text{, and}\\
        \inv\pi({\pi}(I))&=I && \text{for all ideals } M\subseteq I\subseteq R
    \end{align*}
To prove the first statement, observe that, if $J$ is an ideal of $R/M$, then $\inv{\pi}(J)=\{r\in R\mid r+M\in J\}$ and so $$\pi(\inv{\pi}(J))=\{\pi(r)\in R\mid r+M\in J\}= \{r+M\mid r+M\in J\}= J$$

Next, to prove the second statement, first suppose $M\subseteq I\subseteq R$ is an ideal. Let $a\in I$. Then $a+M\in \{\alpha+M\mid \alpha\in I\}=\pi(I)$. This implies that $a\in \inv{\pi}(\pi(I))$, and so \dashuline{$I\subseteq \inv{\pi}(\pi(I))$}. 

Conversely, suppose $r\in \inv{\pi}(\pi(I))$. This is the same as saying $\pi(r)=r+M\in \pi(I)=\{\alpha+M\mid \alpha \in I\}$. Hence, for any $r\in \inv{\pi}(\pi(I))$, there exists some $a\in I$ such that $r+M=a+M$. Thus, $r-a\in M\subseteq I$ by coset conditions. Since $a\in I$, we have $a+(r-a)\in I$, meaning that $r\in I$ for any $r\in \inv{\pi}(\pi(I))$. This means that \dashuline{$\inv{\pi}(\pi(I))\subseteq I$}. 

Hence, \uline{$I= \inv{\pi}(\pi(I))$}. 

Consequently, for any ideals $J\subseteq R/M$, we know that $\inv{\pi}(J)\subseteq R$ is an ideal containing $M$\sidenote{Think about why this contains $M$!}. And if $M\subseteq I\subseteq R$ is an ideal, we know $\pi(I)\subseteq R/M$ is an ideal. Since $\pi(\inv{\pi}(J))= J$ and $I= \inv{\pi}(\pi(I))$ for any $I,J$, the correspondence is a bijection.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    Suppose $R$ is a comm. ring with an identity and $I\subseteq R$ is an ideal. Then $R/I$ is a field \ifnif $I$ is maximal.
\end{proposition}\label[prop]{quotient-max-field}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Quotient by maximal ideal is field}
\begin{proof}
    If $I$ is maximal, then there are no other proper ideals strictly containing $I$. Hence, by \cref{4th-isomorphism-thrm}, we have that $R/I$ only have ideals $(0)$ and $R/I$ itself. This happens \ifnif $R/I$ is a field.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    If $R$ is a commutative ring with identity and $M\subseteq R$ is maximal, then $M$ is prime.\sidenote{Hence \uline{maximal implies prime}, but prime does not necessarily implies maximal.}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Maximal $\implies$ quotient is a field $\implies$ quotient is an ID $\implies$ prime.
\end{proof}

\defn An integral domain $R$ is an \textbf{Euclidean domain} if there exists a norm $N: R\to \Z_{\geq 0}$ with $N(0)=0$ such that for all $a,b\in R$ with $b\neq 0$, there exists $q,r\in R$ for which $$a=bq+r$$ with $N(r)<N(b)$ or $r=0$.
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Euclidean Domain}

\eg $\Z$ is a ED with $N(a)=|a|$.
\eg $\Q[x]$ is a ED with $N(p(x))=\deg (p(x))$.
\eg Every field $F$ is a ED with $N(a)=0\;\forall\; a\in F$.\sidenote{Because in a field everything divides!}
\noneg $\Z\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{-19}}{2}\right]$ is a PID that is not an ED.\sidenote{This is one of the only good examples!}

\subsubsection{Why do we care about Euclidean domains?}
\rmk \underline{Greatest common divisors} exist and are relatively quick to compute. \sidenote{Using recursive application of Euclidean algorithm.}

\defn If $a,b\in R$, then $\gcd (a,b)=c$ means \begin{enumerate}
    \item $c$ divides $a$ and $b$; that is, $a=cr, b=cs$ for some $r,s\in R$
    \item If $c'\in R$ with $c'|a$ and $c'|b$, then it must be true that $c'|c$.\sidenote{All other common divisors divide the gcd.}
\end{enumerate}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Greatest common divisors \& Euclidean algorithm}

\eg Say we want to compute the gcd of 47 and 10.\sidenote{This is a much faster algorithm than factoring!}
\begin{align*}
    47 &= 4\times 10 + 7\\
    10 &= 1\times 7 + 3\\
    7 &= 2\times 3 + \circled{1} && \leftarrow \text{circled is gcd}(47,10)\\
    3 &= 3\times 1 && \leftarrow \text{final line with no remainders}
\end{align*}

This also works for finding gcds in $\Q[x]$ with polynomials long division and norm $\deg (p(x))$.

\rmk If $F$ is a field, then $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain.\sidenote{Just use long division!}

\rmk Euclidean domains are PIDs.
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $R$ is a ED and $I\subseteq R$ is an idea;. Consider $\{N(a)\mid a\in I\backslash \{0\}\}$. This set has a \underline{minimal element} by properties of natural numbers (or is an empty set \ifnif $I=(0)$).

    Let $d\in I$ be an element of \underline{minimum norm} (hence $N(d)\leq N(a)$ for all $a\in I$). We claim that \underline{$(d)=I$}. Proof:

    Since $d\in I$, we have $rd\in I$ for any $r\in R$. This implies that $(d)\subseteq I$.

    Then let $a\in I$. Since $R$ is a ED, we first assumes that there exists $q,r\in R$, $r\neq 0$ such that $a=qd+r$ and $N(r)<N(d)$. But we notice that $r=a-qd$ must be in $I$ as both $a, qd\in I$, contradicting the minimality of $N(d)$. Thus, it must be that $r=0$. This implies $a=qd$ and thus $a\in (d)$ for all $a\in I$. \underline{Consequently, $I\in (d)$}, and therefore $I=(d)$.
\end{proof}

\defn Suppose $R$ is an integral domain and $p\in R\backslash \{0\}$. Then $p$ is a \textbf{prime element} if $(p)$ is a prime ideal.
\addlink{Prime elements}

\begin{proposition}
    An element $p\in R$ is prime \ifnif whenever $p|ab$ then $p|a$ or $p|b$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    $p$ is prime means that $(p)$ is a prime ideal. This is true \ifnif whenever $ab\in (p)$ then $a\in (p)$ or $b\in (p)$. This is the same as saying if $ab=kp$ for some $k\in R$ then $a=lp$ or $b=lp$ for some $l\in R$. This is to say that whenever $p|ab$ then $p|a$ or $p|b$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    In an integral domain, all prime elenments are irreducibles.
\end{proposition}
\addlink{Prime implies irreducible in ID}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $R$ is an ID and $p\in R$ is prime. If $p=ab$ for some $a,b$ in $R$, then, WLOG, $p|a$. That is, $a=pk$ for some $k\in R$. Hence, $p=pkb$. Since in an ID cancellation rule holds, $kb=1$, meaning that $b$ is a unit. Thus, $p$ is irreducible by definition \cref{unit-irreducible}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    In PIDs, all \textit{nonzero }prime ideals are maximal.
\end{proposition}
\addlink{Prime implies maximal in PID}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $R$ is a PID and $(p)\subseteq R$ is a prime ideal. If $(p)\subseteq (m)\subseteq R$ is an ideal, then $p\in (p)\subseteq (m)$ hence $p=rm$ for some $r\in R$. Since $p|rm$, we have $p|r$ or $p|m$.

    If $p|r$, this implies that $r=pk$ for some $k\in R$. Substituting into $p=rm$, we get $p=pkm$. By cancellation, we get $km=1$, meaning that $m$ is a unit. Hence, $(m)=R$.

    If $p|m$, we have $m=pl$ for some $l\in R$, meaning that $m\in (p)$. Hence, $(m)\subseteq (p)$, but we also defined that $(p)\subseteq (m)$, so $(m)=(p)$.

    Therefore, $(p)$ has to be the maximal ideal.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    In an UFD, irreducible implies prime.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let $R$ be a UFD and $p\in R$ be irreducible. Let $a,b\in R$ such that $p|ab$. Hence, $pr=ab$ for some $r\in R$. Since $R$ is a UFD, let $a=q_1\dots q_n, b= s_1\dots s_m$ be the factorization. Since the factorizations are unique and each of the $q_i, s_j$ are irreducible, if $p|ab$, then $p$ must be an associate with one of the $q_i, s_j$. Therefore, either $p|a$ or $p|b$, implying prime.
\end{proof}
\addlink{Irreducible implies prime in UFD}

\eg $\Q$ is a field, so $\Q[x]$ is a ED. Since EDs are UFDs, irreducible $\implies$ prime. We see that $x^2-2\in \Q[x]$ is an irreducible element, which means that $(x^2-2)$ is a prime ideal, meaning that it is a maximum ideal, meaning that $\Q[x]/(x^2-2)$ is a field. We observe that it is a field containing $\Q$ and $(\sqrt{2})$.\sidenote{In fact, this is the smallest field containing $\Q$ and $(\sqrt{2})$.}

\begin{lemma}
    In a PID, irreducible elements are prime.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    \parskip =0pt
    Suppose $p\in R$ is irreducible in the principal ideal domain $R$. If $p|ab$ for some $a,b\in R$, we want to show that either $p|a$ or $p|b$, hereby showing that $p$ is prime. Hence, we consider the ideal $(a,p)=d$, which is necessarily principal for some $d\in R$. Since $a,p\in (d)$, we have $a=dr$ and $p=ds$ for some $r,s\in R$. As $p$ is irreducible, we get that one of $d$ and $s$ is a unit. 
    
    We first assume that $s$ is a unit, in which case $d=p\inv s$, and so $a=p\inv sr$ implying that $p|a$. 
    
    In another case, $d$ is a unit, in which case $(a,p)=(d)=R$ and so $1=ak+pl$ for some $k,l\in R$. Multiplying by $b$, we get $b=abk+pbl$. Since $p|ab$, we have $b=abk+pbl=pmk+pbl$ for some $m\in R$. Hence, $b=p(mk+bl)$, meaning that $p|b$.

    Therefore, whenever $p|ab$, either $p|a$ or $p|b$. Hence, in a PID, $p$ is prime whenever it is irreducible.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    PIDs are UFDs.
\end{proposition}\addlink{PIDs are UFDs}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $R$ is a PID and $a\in R$ is nonzero, nonunit. If $a$ is irreducible, we are done. If not, we write $a=p_1q_1$ for some $p_1,q_1\in R$ nonunit. If $p_1,q_1$ are irreducibles, we are done. If not, then WLOG say $q_1=p_2q_2$ for some nonunits $p_2,q_2$. We would like to show that this splitting process terminates.

    Observe that $(q_1)\subseteq (q_2)$ since $q_2|q_1$. Hence, the chain of splitting results in the chain of ideals $(q_1)\subseteq (q_2)\subseteq (q_3)\subseteq \dots$.

    Now consider the ideal\footnote{The proof that this is an ideal is as follows:
    
    We first prove that $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ is a subgroup of $R$ under addition. Let $r,s\in \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$, where $r\in I_k$ and $s\in I_{k+i}$ for some $k,i\in \N$. Since $I_1\subseteq I_2\subseteq \dots$ are ideals of $R$, we know that $r\in I_k$ implies that $r\in I_{k+i}$. Thus, $r-s\in I_{k+i}$ due to $I_{k+i}$ being an ideal. As $I_{k+i}\subseteq \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$, we have $r-s\in \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$, which means that $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ is closed under additive inverse. Hence, \dashuline{$\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ is a subgroup of $R$ under addition.}

Then, we prove that for any $t\in R$, $r\in \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$, we would have $tr,rt\in \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$. Since $r\in \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$, it must be true that $r\in I_k$ for some $k\in \N$. Hence, $tr,rt \in I_k$  due to $I_{k}$ being an ideal. Therefore, \dashuline{$tr,rt \in \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ for any $t\in R$, $r\in \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$.}

In conclusion, since $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ is a subgroup of $R$ under addition with the property that $tr,rt \in \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ for any $t\in R$, $r\in \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$, it is an ideal of $R$.\qed
} $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}(q_i)$. Since this is a PID, we have $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}(q_i)=(q)$ for some $q\in R$. Since $q\in \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}(q_i)$, it is contained in some $(q_n)$ for some $n\geq 1$. This implies that $(q)\subseteq (q_n)$, but we also know that $(q_n)\subseteq (q)$, hence $(q)=(q_n)$. Hence, this process terminates, and there exists an $n$ in this chain such that $q_n$ is irreducible. Therefore, $R$ is a \uline{factorization domain}.

Now we want to prove the \uline{uniqueness}. That is, if $p_1\dots p_n = q_1\dots q_m$ for irreducibles $p_i,q_j$ and $n\leq m$ WLOG, then we want to show that $m=n$ and that $p_i=u_iq_i$ with units $u_i$ up to reordering for all $i$. We do so by induction on $n$.
\begin{itemize}[align=left]
    \item[(\textit{Base case})] If $p_1=q_1\dots q_m$ and $p_1$ irreducible, then $q_2\dots q_m$ are all units. Hence, $m=1$ and $p_1=q_1$.
    \item[(\textit{Inductive step})] Say we have already proven the statement for $n=k$. Then consider $p_1p_2\dots p_{k+1}=q_1q_2\dots q_m$. Since $R$ is a PID where irreducible implies prime, $p_1$ is a prime element dividing the product of primes $q_1q_2\dots q_m$, so we say WLOG $p_1|q_1$. This means that $q_1=u_1p_1$ for some $u\in R$, but since $q_1$ is not reducible, it forces $u_1$ to be a unit. Hence, we apply cancellation on both sides and get $p_2\dots p_{k+1}=(u_1q_2)\dots q_m$.
\end{itemize}
By inductive hypothesis, $m-1=k$ and $p_i, q_i$ are associates up to reordering for any $i$. Hence, the factorization must be \uline{unique}.

\section{Field extensions}
We observe that the polynomial $x^2-2\in \Q [x]$ is irreducible. If we have $x^2-2=p(x)q(x)$ where $p,q$ nonunits, then $\deg(p)+\deg(q)=2$ and we cannot have any $0+2$ combinations due to constants being units, we only have $x^2-2=(x-\sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2})$, but $x±\sqrt{2}\notin \Q[x]$!

Since $\Q[x]$ is a UFD, the irreducible element $(x^2-2)$ is prime, and since $\Q[x]$ is a PID, $(x^2-2)$ is maximal which means that $\Q[x]/(x^2-2)$ is a field.

Suppose $F$ is a field and $p(x)\in F[x]$ nonzero. Recall that $F[x]$ is a ED with the norm function $\deg (a(x))$ and long division of polynomials. \sidenote{$a(x)$ is a coset rep}Let $a(x)+(p(x))\in F[x]/(p(x))$. By the division algorithm\sidenote{We can do division algorithm since this is an ED}, we have $a(x)=p(x)q(x)+r(x)$ for $q(x),r(x)\in F[x]$ and $\deg(r(x))<\deg(p(x))$ or $r(x)$ is the zero polynomial.

Now we see that since $a(x)-r(x)\in (p(x))$, they are in the same coset! Hence $a(x)+(p(x))=r(x)+(p(x))$. We observe that \uline{every element of $F[x]/(p(x))$ can be represented by a polynomial of a degree less than $\deg(p(x))$}. In other words, if $\deg(p(x))=n$, then $F[x]/(p(x))$ is of the form \sidenote{\scriptsize The expression under the bar functions like $r(x)$! Also note that span is just the set of linear combinations.}
\begin{align*}
    F[x]/(p(x))&=\left \{\,\overline{a_0+a_1x+\dots +a_{n-1}x^{n-1}}\bigm\vert a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{n-1}\in F \right \}\\
    &= \text{Span}_F\{\bar 1, \bar x, \dots, \bar{x^{n-1}}\}
\end{align*}\sidenote{Why is this not the vector space over $F/(p(x))$ but just $F$? See the next paragraph.}
In fact, $F[x]/(p(x))$ is (partly) just a \textbf{vector space} over $F$\dots

We shall observe that it does not matter if we are using $F$ or $\bar F$.\\
Consider $\varphi: F\hookrightarrow F[x]/(p(x))$ where $a\mapsto \bar a$. We observe this is an \textbf{injective} map: whenever $\deg(p(x))=n>0$, we have $\homo{a}=\homo{b}$ \ifnif $\bar a=\bar b$, which happens \ifnif $a-b\in (p(x))$; but the difference of two constants always have deg 0 and cannot be in $(p(x))$ unless it is a straight zero, which tells us that $\bar a = \bar b$ \ifnif $a=b$. \uline{In other words, $F[x]/(p(x))$ contains an isomorphic copy of $F$, its field of scalars!} Namely, \circled{$F\cong \homo{F}=\{\bar a \in F[x]/(p(x))\mid a\in F\}$}.

\dots Hence, $F[x]/(p(x))$ is a vector space \textbf{of dimension $n$} over the scalar field $F$ that also contains an isomorpic copy of $F$.
\addlink{$F[x]/(p(x))$ contains a copy of $F$}

Moreover, \uline{if $p(x)$ is irreducible}, then $(p(x))$ is prime since this is an ED, and hence, it is also a maximal\sidenote{all thanks to Euclidean domains!} ideal, meaning that \uline{$F[x]/(p(x))$ is a field containing an isomorphic copy of $F$}.

\defn Suppose $F\subseteq K$ are fields. Then $K$ is called a \textbf{field extension} of $F$.
\addlink{Field extension, degree of extension}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Notation: $K/F$\sidenote{Please, this is NOT a quotient. DO NOT CONFUSE THOSE!!} or \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&,cramped,sep=tiny]
        K \\

        \arrow[no head, from=1-1, to=2-1]
    \end{tikzcd} (\textit{the lattice notation})
\end{itemize}
The dimension of $K$ as a vector space over $F$ is called the \textbf{degree} of the extension.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Notation: $[K:F]$
\end{itemize}

But does my field $F$ always have an extension? Here is a systematic way to get extensions:

\eg If $p(x)\in F[x]$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree $n\geq 1$ over the field $F$, then $F[x]/(p(x))$ is a \textbf{field extension} of $F$\sidenote{Since $\homo{F}\cong F$, and $\homo{F}\subseteq F[x]/(p(x))$} of degree $n$.\\ Furthermore, if $p(x)=a_0+a_1x+\dots +a_nx^n$, then $\bar x$ is a \textbf{root} of $$\homo{p(x)}=\bar a_0+\bar a_1y + \dots + \bar a_ny^n\in \left(\,F[x]/(p(x))\,\right)[y]$$\sidenote{We think about modding out by $(p(x))$ as making it equal to zero, which is how we find roots.} because, plugging in $y=\bar x$, we get \begin{equation*}
    \bar a_0+\bar a_1\bar x + \dots + \bar a_n\bar x^n= \overline{p(x)}=\bar 0 \in F[x]/(p(x))
\end{equation*}
Hence, \uline{the isomorphic copy of the polynomial $p(x)$ has \textbf{roots} in the field extension $F[x]/(p(x))$}.

So, what the hell is $F[x]/(p(x))$? We have already shown that the field extension $F[x]/(p(x))$ does indeed contain a root of $p(x)$. Now we think about it \textbf{the other way around}: if we want to find an extension of $F$ that contains a root of $p(x)$, we would eventually get this one!

Suppose $p(x)\in F[x]$ is irreducible. Let $K/F$ be an extension, and $\alpha\in K$ a root of $p(x)$. Denote by $F(\alpha)\subseteq K$ the \textbf{smallest} subfield of $K$ that contains both $F$ and $\alpha$. Consider the map $\varphi : F[x]\to F(\alpha)\subseteq K$ where $q(x)\mapsto q(\alpha)$ is simply the evaluation at $\alpha$ map. We note that $p(x)\in \ker(\varphi) = (d(x))$ since an ED is a PID; this implies that $p(x)=u(x)d(x)$. As $p(x)$ is irreducible, $u(x)$ must be a unit, which means $p(x)$ and $d(x)$ are associates and $\ker(\varphi)=(p(x))$. Therefore, $$F[x]/(p(x))= F[x]/\ker(\varphi)\cong \homo{F[x]}\subseteq F(\alpha)$$ by first isomorphism theorem\sidenote{Observe that $\homo{F[x]}$ is a field: $\ker(\varphi)$ is a maximal ideal}. However, $F(\alpha)\subseteq K$ the \textbf{smallest} subfield of $K$ that contains both $F$ and $\alpha$, so $\homo{F[x]}$ cannot be smaller than that. Hence, it must be true that $\homo{F[x]}=F(\alpha)$.

Therefore, \uline{$F(\alpha)$ is simply $F[x]/(p(x))$.}

\subsubsection{To summarize so far!}
Suppose $p(x)\in F[x]$ is an irreducible polynomial with coefficients in the field $F$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $F[x]/p(x)$ is a \textbf{field} containing an isomorphic copy of $F$ in which $\overline x = x+(p(x))$ is a \textbf{root} of (the image of) $p(y)\in (F[x]/(p(x)))[y]$. 
    
    \eg In $\Q[x]/(x^2-2)$, we have $x+(x^2-2)$ is a root of $y^2-\overline 2\in (\Q[x]/(x^2-2))[y]$ because \begin{align*}
        &\;(x+(x^2-2))^2 - (2+(x^2-2)) \\
        &= x^2-2 + (x^2-2) && \text{by coset addition \& multiplication}\\
        &= 0 + (x^2-2) && \text{since }x^2-2\in (x^2-2)\\
        &= \bar 0

    \begin{proposition}
        If $p(x)\in F[x]$, then $\alpha\in F$ is a root \ifnif $x-\alpha$ divides $p(x)$.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        Write $p(x)=(x-\alpha)q(x)+r(x)$ with $q(x),r(x)\in F[x]$ and $\deg (r(x))=0$ or $r(x)=0$. Then $0=p(\alpha)=0+r(\alpha)$ which forces $r(x)=0$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{corollary}
        A degree-2 or -3 polynomial over a field $F$ is irreducible \ifnif it has no roots in $F$.
    \end{corollary}

    \begin{proposition}
        Suppose $p(x)=a_0+a_1x+\dots + a_nx^n\in \Z[x]$ with root $\frac{c}{d}$ written in reduced from (i.e. gcd$(c,d)=1$). Then \circled{$c|a_0$ and $d|a_n$}.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        \begin{align*}
            d^n \cdot p\left(\frac{c}{d}\right) &=0\\
            0&= (a_0d^n + a_1 d^{n-1} c+ \dots +a_{n-1}dc^{n-1}) + a_nc^n\\
            0&= a_0d^n + (a_1 d^{n-1} c+ \dots +a_{n-1}dc^{n-1} + a_nc^n)
        \end{align*}

        Looking at the 2nd line, since $d$ divides all of the ones in the (), it must also divide the last term $a_nc^n$. However, since gcd$(c,d)=1$, it forces $d$ to divide $a_n$.

        Similarly, we make the same argument for $c$ and $a_0$ using the 3rd line.

    \begin{proposition}[Eisenstein's Criterion]
        \addlink{Eisenstein's Criterion}
        Suppose $f(x)=\mathbb1x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots + a_1x+a_0\in \Z[x]$ is a monic polynomial and $p\in \Z$ is a \textbf{prime} such that $p\mid a_0,\dots,a_{n-1}$ but $p^2\nmid a_0$. Then \underline{$f(x)$ is irreducible}.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        Assume BWOC that $f(x)=a(x)b(x)$ for some nonunit $a(x),b(x)\in \Z[x]$, then $$x^n=\bar f(x)=\bar a(x) \bar b(x)$$
        in $(\Z/p\Z)[x]\cong \Z[x]/p\Z[x]$ since all other terms are divisible by $p$. Since $\Z/p\Z$ does not contain any zero divisors, $\bar a(x), \bar b(x)$ must have zero constant terms. Hence $a(x),b(x)$ have constant terms that are multiples of $p$, so $a(x)b(x)$ have constant term divisible by $p^2$. This is a contradiction with $p^2\nmid a_0$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}[Gauss' Lemma]
        \addlink{Gauss' Lemma}
        If $p(x)\in \Z[x]$ is reducible in $\Q[x]$, then it is reducible in $\Z[x]$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose $p(x)=a(x)b(x)$ for $a(x),b(x)\in \Q[x]$. Then by multiplying by coefficient denominators, for some $m\in \Z$, we could write $m\cdot p(x)= c(x)d(x)$ for some $c(x),d(x)\in \Z[x]$. Now since $m\in \Z$, we could write $m=q_1q_2\dots q_n$ be a product of irreducibles in $\Z$.
        
        Now in $(\Z/q_1\Z)[x]\cong \Z[x]/(q_1\Z)[x]$, we observe that $m\cdot p(x)= c(x)d(x)=q_1(q_2\dots q_n)p(x)$, meaning that \begin{align*}
            \overline{c(x)}\,\overline{d(x)}=\overline{q_1(q_2\dots q_n)p(x)}=\overline 0
        \end{align*}
        Since $(\Z/q_1\Z)[x]\cong \Z[x]/(q_1\Z)[x]$ is an \uline{integral domain}\sidenote{since $q_1$ is irreducible and hence prime in UFD}, WLOG, $\overline{c(x)}=\overline 0$ \ifnif $c(x)\in q_1\Z[x]$, meaning that all coefficients of $c(x)$ are multiples or $q_1$. Therefore, $\dfrac{1}{q_1}c(x)\in \Z[x]$.

        Now we repeat the process for all $q_1,q_2,\dots ,q_n$ and we are done.
    \end{proof}

    Recall that if $F\subseteq K$ are fields, $\alpha\in K$ and $p(x)\in F[x]$ is irreducible with root $\alpha$, then $$F[\alpha]=F(\alpha)\cong F[x]/(p(x))=\{\overline{a_0+a_1x+\dots+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}}\mid a_0,a_1\dots,a_{n-1}\in F\}$$

    We observe that this has a few implications. For instance, $F(\alpha)$ contains $\frac{1}{\alpha}$\sidenote{since it is a field containing the mult. inverse of $\alpha$}, meaning that it could also be written as a polynomial of $\alpha$ with coefficients in $F$ (as in $F[\alpha]$)!

    \defn Suppose $K/F$ is a field extension and $\alpha\in K$. We say that $\alpha$ is \textbf{algebraic over $F$} if there exists $p(x)\in F[x]$ such that $p(\alpha)=0$. If not, $\alpha$ is \textbf{transcendental}.

    \addlink{Finite extensions are algebraic}
    \begin{proof}
        Call $[K:F]=n$ and let $\alpha\in K$. Then the $n+1$ elements $\{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\dots, \alpha^n\}$ must be \uline{linearly dependent}\sidenote{since $n+1>\dim(K/F)=n$}. Hence, by linear algebra, there exist $a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n\in F$ not all zero such that the linear combination $a_0+a_1\alpha+a_2\alpha^2+\dots +a_n\alpha^n=0$. Hence, $\alpha$ is a root of $a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\dots +a_nx^n=0$.
